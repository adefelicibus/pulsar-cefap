## Place local configuration variables used by Pulsar and run.sh in here. For example

## If using the drmaa queue manager, you will need to set the DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH variable,
## you may also need to update LD_LIBRARY_PATH for underlying library as well.
#export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libdrmaa.so


## If you wish to use a variety of Galaxy tools that depend on galaxy.eggs being defined,
export GALAXY_HOME=/mnt/galaxy
